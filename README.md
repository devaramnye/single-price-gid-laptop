## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to be more aware and reinforced with the HTML5 semantic and try to stay clean in HTML & CSS as I want to have a good view of my projects. My goal is to use tailwindCSS or SCSS to continue coding.
